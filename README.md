# Contact Conundrum




## Reason for Making the App

The primary objective of this app is to transform the process of acquiring contacts into an engaging and gamified learning experience. In a world where memorizing phone numbers has become a thing of the past, our app aims to make the task of gathering and remembering contacts not only functional but also enjoyable.

## Elements Used

The app is built using the following technologies:

- **Node.js:** Used for server-side development.
- **Axios:** A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- **HTML, CSS, JS:** Front-end technologies for creating the user interface.
