## Reason for Making the App

The primary objective of this app is to transform the process of acquiring contacts into an engaging and gamified learning experience.

## Elements Used

The app is built using the following technologies:

- **Node.js:** Used for server-side development.
- **Axios:** A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- **HTML, CSS, JS:** Front-end technologies for creating the user interface.
- **Bootstrap:** Mobile first CSS framework.
- **Express:**  A back end web application framework for building RESTful APIs with Node.js
